# ee-goes

An experimental library to make GOES-R time series collection building and animation easier with helper functions for common tasks. I use this library for proof-of-concept animations. I recommend not using it directly as it is likely to change in the near future; it would be better to copy functions/snippets to integrate in your our scripts.

Here is an example script for useage: https://code.earthengine.google.com/9ddfd46eb758287a02ec7f49a2495365
